# Statistics study

Studying the statistics and briefly recording it

First, I am attending a lecture, and summarize it

### April 14, 2017
#### Meta-analysis
- statistical analysis that combines results of multiple studies
- typically, meta-analysis involves combining summary statistics


- Fixed effects model
  - Most use..
  - = inverse-variance method
  - 
  
  
- Weighted sum of z-scores


- Fisher's method
  - p-value --> p-value
    - In case of no direction of effect
    - Know direction --> z-score --> WSoZ
  - follow chi-square distribution + degree of freedom of 2K
  
  
 - Heterogeneity


#### Multiple testing correction
- statistical tests multiple times --> p-value needs to be adjusted
- P-value definition
  - probability of getting same or more extreme outcomes in random under null hypothesis
  - p-value p <= alpha --> reject null hypothesis (declare association)
  -         p > alpha --> accept null hypothesis
- Type I error rate
  - also called 'false positive rate'
  - probability that null hypothesis will be falsely rejected
    - prob(reject null | null is true)
